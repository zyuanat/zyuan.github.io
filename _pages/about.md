# 👋 About Me
Hi, I am Zheng YUAN, a second-year Ph.D. student at [DEEPLab](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~xiaohuang/deeplab.html) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University ([PolyU](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/)), under the supervision of Prof. [Xiao Huang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~xiaohuang/). I received a dual bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics with Mathematics from Jinan University ([JNU](https://english.jnu.edu.cn/)) and the University of Birmingham ([UoB](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/)). I was fortunately supervised by Prof. [Feiran Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=of1vcxsAAAAJ&hl) at JNU and worked closely with Dr. [Hao Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7oeLWT0AAAAJ&hl) at CityU Macau.

My current research interests include **large language models and their applications**, **information extraction**, and **code (SQL) generation**. During my free time, I enjoy customizing mechanical keyboards and playing video games. Please feel free to reach me out!
